                <h2>The Crisp Apple</h2>
                <p>Address: 11520 24 St SE #768, Calgary, AB T2Z 0V2</p>
                <p>For my friends down south, located in Douglas Square Shopping Centre, situates The Crisp Apple. It is a family-run, Canadian-owned company that has been in the business for over 23 years. They carry a variety of fruits, vegetables, dry and wet ingredients.</p>
                
                <p>My experience shopping in the store was decent. The store layout I would say is pretty straightforward. You are welcomed with fruit and vegetable displays, mainly showcasing those with deals and a wall of their jams and syrups. They also offer precut, prepacked fruits to-go making it more convenient to consume at any time. Located in the corner of their store is their Crisp & Salsa Bar where they offer fresh juices, and smoothies along with chips and salsa. It was quite slow and tame on a Monday morning and the staff were very friendly.</p>

                
                <p>What is amazing is they are also easily accessible in the comfort of your own home. On their website, you can find a list of items they sell along with a price, they also include their address and contact information. For online orders, they offer curbside pickup as well as home delivery for convenience. To learn more about Crisp Apple, click here.</p>

            <h2>H&W Produce</h2>
            <p>Address: 3508 32 Ave NE, Calgary, AB T1Y 6J2</p>
            <p><i>“Spend Less for Fresh”</i></p>
            <p>Up at the Northeast is one of seven produce stores of H&W Produce. They have five locations in Edmonton, one in Sherwood Park and one here in Calgary. Being a local business, their mission is to provide our communities with products that are locally sourced while fostering strong community connections. They also shop around the globe for a wider variety of produce.</p>

            <p>Their location is situated beside a Dollarama and also near a Fresco, for a more budget-friendly shopping experience. The store has a more low-lit ambiance allowing the vibrance of the produce to speak for itself. There was more foot traffic at this location on a Monday morning, and the staff were actively stocking up the produce as well.</p> 
                
            <p>If you are ever curious about their Weekly specials, it is easily accessible on their website. They also include a set of recipes for customers to recreate by using their produce. For other businesses, they also have a Wholesale division for bulk purchases and quality produce delivery. To learn more about H&W Produce, click here.</p>

                <h2>Freestone Produce</h2>
                <p>Address: 2828 32 Ave NE, Calgary, AB T1Y 5J4</p>
                <p>In the heart of Northeast Calgary is Freestone Produce, a family-owned produce wholesaler. They have been open since 2010, providing an affordable price on quality produce. They sell a variety of fruits, vegetables, wet and dry ingredients. At an incredibly cheap price, you can buy quality ingredients in bulk. </p>
                <p>Immediately out at the parking lot, you would find yourself battling for parking, and once you are inside, expect heavy foot traffic. The staff were actively stocking produce as well, pulling wooden pallets of produce whilst managing through the crowd, so it could get a bit chaotic when shopping. They also have a walk-in chilled produce section that stores cheap juice options and fruits. They also have a generous selection of spices and a variety of pickled produce. Remember to bring a loonie for their carts, you are going to need it.</p>
                <p>Their website mainly caters to vendors who can easily avail themselves of their inventory needs. If ever curious, they have also included a list of their produce for their regular customers. To get an idea of how the inside looks like, they have also included a gallery showcasing their produce and interior. To learn more about Freestone Produce, click here.</p>
